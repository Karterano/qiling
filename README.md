## Qiling 

This is a fork of the original [Qiling](https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling) framework, extended with the work of the master thesis "*Reverse Engineering UEFI Firmware to Discover Hidden CPU Features*". The changes are on branch ***more_protocols***, and are mostly documented in the thesis itself. Refer to the documentation of the other repository *Master_Code* for further information on the use of Qiling and the obtained results.
